## Dataset
Create a directory called ```data``` at the root directory. Download the [KLJ Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KIqIyHKIvIAqPsVARJLrWcvaGzogvObq) and extract them to the ```data``` directory. You should see ```KJL_features``` and ```KJL_reference``` in ```data```.

## Training 
Run ```python train.py``` at the root directory. Checkpoint and visualizations using validation data are written to ```checkpoint``` and ```validation``` directories. You can modify the hyperparameters in ```config.py```.
